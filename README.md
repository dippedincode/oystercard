# Oystercard

> This week's challenge will start with going back over the basics we covered last week in Boris Bikes, giving you the chance to reinforce what you learned last week. You'll then be challenged to build a more complex system which should really stretch your skills in Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design.

The week two challenge at Makers Academy. Create an Oyster card based on User Stories, using Test Driven Development with the Red Green Refactor methodology.
